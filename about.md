My name is Tim (Yao) Wang, I've working on frontend development for over three years. I'm currently a master student of computer science in the UK.

I create apps and websites. Design and develop user interface is always a fascinating work for me because this is the place I could feel, understand and talk with the users.

I love open source community and also make my contribution to it. Some of my work can be found on [Github](https://github.com/timwangdev).

You can send email to [tim.wangyao@gmail.com](mailto:tim.wangyao@gmail.com) or DM me on [Twitter(@timwangdev)](https://twitter.com/timwangdev).
