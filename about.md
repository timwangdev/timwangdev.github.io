My name is Tim (Yao) Wang, and I'm currently working in Shanghai as a frontend developer. I create apps and websites. Design and develop user interface is always a fascinating work for me because this is the place I could feel, understand and talk with the users.

I love open source community and also make my contribution to it. Some of my work can be found on [Github](https://github.com/timwangdev).

You can send email to [i@timwang.me](mailto:i@timwang.me) or "@" me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/timwangdev).
